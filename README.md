The application is divided into frontend and backend part. In order for the application to work, three servers are started:

- the server on the frontend
- the server on the backend
- the server for the mysql database

## Frontend

The frontend is made with the **React js**. <br />
All code related to the frontend is located in the [front](/front/) folder.

## Backend

The backend is made with the programming language **Go**. Communication with the database is done through the backend. <br />
All code related to the backend is located in the [server](/server/) folder.
