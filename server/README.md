# Server side

Welcome to the server side of this project.

You can run the code from the terminal using the command: go run .

If the code does not work, you probably did not finish the setup for using mongoDB. For that visit the following link: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/go/current/quick-start/

Thank you for using Event-Reminder :).
